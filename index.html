            Hi my name is Mohammed Tijani, I am a recent graduate from the
            University at Albany, My journey of programming began when I was in
            highschool, I fell in love with a 2D MMORPG game and decided to
            build my own private server off of it, it quickly amassed to 5500+
            members, from then on I knew I wanted to study programming, I went on
            to study CS, during my studies I worked on numerous
            projects. One of them I partnered with
            another school to develop a CGM application for people with
            diabetes. After my studies I started my own private online service
            business venture for small local businesses. Recently I joined FastTrack
            a competitive 8 week program that trained me for the programming industry,
            we worked on Java, Angular, Spring, REST APIs, PostGres and Git. We also worked
            on professional development and what it takes to be a good employee.

                    Developed a compiler in Java for the “Shank” language,

                  <li>
                    Implemented semantic analysis, tree nodes, and efficient
                    memory management techniques improving the compiler's
                    performance by 75%.

                    Inspired by new generation security cameras, built a program

                    camera frame and returned the screen match percentage using
                    a basic algorithm.
